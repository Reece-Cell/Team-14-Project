# Team-14-Project
gpt based program that will generate an essay based on a user input topic and focus

There are two prerequistes to getting this project running.
First, you need to have tensorflow installed, I used version 1.15
Secondly,  you need to download a gpt model from open-ai
The project uses the 355M version of the model but you can just as easily use any of the versions and simply change the model version in the code
You can easily download any of the models from here https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2
Once you generate the essay, it will show up in the project folder under the name "my_essay.txt"
There was a slight effort made in terms of formatting so copy the essay and paste it into a word processor such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word to see the formatting
