# Team-14-Project
The Essay Generator is a piece of software designed to replicate an essay on a given topic and/or theme provided by the user. The essay emulates this theme via a corresponding wikipedia article to said topic, provided such an article exists. When the input is checked for on wikipedia, the user is then prompted with a sub topic to have the essay focus on. Shortly after a period of generation for the code, the program will produce an essay on the topic, prompting the user to save it to their harddrive.
